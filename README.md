GPU architectures are critical to machine learning, and seem to be
becoming even more important every day. However, you can be an expert
in machine learning without ever touching GPU code. It is hard to gain
intuition working through abstractions. 

This notebook is an attempt to teach beginner GPU programming in a
completely interactive fashion. Instead of providing text with
concepts, it throws you right into coding and building GPU
kernels. The exercises use NUMBA which directly maps Python
code to CUDA kernels. It looks like Python but is basically
identical to writing low-level CUDA code. 
In a few hours, I think you can go from basics to
understanding the real algorithms that power 99% of deep learning
today. If you do want to read the manual, it is here:
